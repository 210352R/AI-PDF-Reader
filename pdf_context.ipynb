Note : Please use diagrams in your explanations\\n\\nA double linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains two pointers: one to the next node in the list and one to the previous node. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes in the list, as well as for traversing the list in either direction.\\n\\nA circular linked list is a special type of linked list in which the last node points back to the first node. This creates a circular loop, which allows for efficient traversal of the list.\\n\\nHere is a diagram of a double linked list:\\n\\n[Image of a double linked list]\\n\\nHere is a diagram of a circular linked list:\\n\\n[Image of a circular linked list]\\n\\nQuestion 2 : Write pseudo codes for the operations of a single linked list .\\n\\nThe following pseudo codes implement the basic operations of a single linked list:\\n\\n```\\n# Create a new linked list\\n\\ndef create_linked_list():\\n  head = None\\n  return head\\n\\n# Insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list\\n\\ndef insert_at_beginning(head, data):\\n  new_node = Node(data)\\n  new_node.next = head\\n  head = new_node\\n\\n# Insert a new node at the end of the linked list\\n\\ndef insert_at_end(head, data):\\n  new_node = Node(data)\\n  if head is None:\\n    head = new_node\\n  else:\\n    current_node = head\\n    while current_node.next is not None:\\n      current_node = current_node.next\\n    current_node.next = new_node\\n\\n# Delete a node from the beginning of the linked list\\n\\ndef delete_at_beginning(head):\\n  if head is None:\\n    return\\n  head = head.next\\n\\n# Delete a node from the end of the linked list\\n\\ndef delete_at_end(head):\\n  if head is None:\\n    return\\n  current_node = head\\n  while current_node.next is not None:\\n    previous_node = current_node\\n    current_node = current_node.next\\n  previous_node.next = None\\n\\n# Find a node in the linked list\\n\\ndef find_node(head, data):\\n  current_node = head\\n  while current_node is not None:\\n    if current_node.data == data:\\n      return current_node\\n    current_node = current_node.next\\n\\n# Print the linked list\\n\\ndef print_linked_list(head):\\n  current_node = head\\n  while current_node is not None:\\n    print(current_node.data)\\n    current_node = current_node.next\\n```\\n\\nQuestion 3 : How can you implement a stack and a queue using a linked list ? Note : Explain how you would do it and also write pseudo codes for all the operations .\\n\\nA stack can be implemented using a linked list by using the head of the list as the top of the stack. When a new element is pushed onto the stack, it is added to the head of the list. When an element is popped from the stack, it is removed from the head of the list.\\n\\nA queue can be implemented using a linked list by using the tail of the list as the front of the queue. When a new element is enqueued into the queue, it is added to the tail of the list. When an element is dequeued from the queue, it is removed from the front of the list.\\n\\nThe following pseudo codes implement the operations of a stack and a queue using a linked list:\\n\\n**Stack**\\n\\n```\\n# Create a new stack\\n\\ndef create_stack():\\n  stack = None\\n  return stack\\n\\n# Push an element onto the stack\\n\\ndef push(stack, data):\\n  new_node = Node(data)\\n  new_node.next = stack\\n  stack = new_node\\n\\n# Pop an element from the stack\\n\\ndef pop(stack):\\n  if stack is None:\\n    return None\\n  data = stack.data\\n  stack = stack.next\\n  return data\\n\\n# Peek at the top element of the stack\\n\\ndef peek(stack):\\n  if stack is None:\\n    return None\\n  return stack.data\\n\\n# Check if the stack is empty\\n\\ndef is_empty(',\n",
