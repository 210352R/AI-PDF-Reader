      "{'query': 'What is the linked list', 'history': \"Human: Give answers for this assignment 1st quection?\\nAI: **Question 1:** Explain briefly what a double linked list and a circular linked list is?\\n\\n**Note:** Please use diagrams in your explanations\\n\\nA **double linked list** is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains two pointers: one to the next node in the list and one to the previous node. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes in the middle of the list, as well as traversal of the list in either direction.\\n\\nA **circular linked list** is a special type of linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular loop. This has the advantage that the list can be traversed in either direction, and that the end of the list can be detected by simply checking whether the current node's next pointer points to the first node.\\n\\nHere are some diagrams that illustrate the difference between a double linked list and a circular linked list:\\n\\n* **Double linked list:**\\n\\n```\\n[ 1 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 3 ] -> [ 4 ] -> [ 5 ]\\n   ^       ^       ^       ^       ^\\n   |       |       |       |       |\\n   [ prev ] [ next ] [ prev ] [ next ] [ prev ]\\n```\\n\\n* **Circular linked list:**\\n\\n```\\n[ 1 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 3 ] -> [ 4 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ 1 ]\\n   ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^\\n   |       |       |       |       |       |\\n   [ prev ] [ next ] [ prev ] [ next ] [ prev ] [ next ]\\n```\\nHuman: Give answers  for the next quection in this assignment?\\nAI: Question 3 How can you implement a stack and a queue using a linked list ? Note : Explain how you would do it and also write pseudo codes for all the operations .\", 'result': 'A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains two items: data and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head and the last node is called the tail.\\n\\nA linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked. In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the list, but not to the previous node. In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next node and the previous node.\\n\\nLinked lists are a dynamic data structure, which means that they can grow and shrink as needed. This makes them well-suited for applications where the size of the data set is not known in advance or where the data set is constantly changing.\\n\\nLinked lists are also efficient for inserting and deleting elements from the middle of the list. However, they are not as efficient for accessing elements at the beginning or end of the list.\\n\\nHere is a diagram of a singly linked list:\\n\\n[Image of a singly linked list]\\n\\nAnd here is a diagram of a doubly linked list:\\n\\n[Image of a doubly linked list]'}\n"
